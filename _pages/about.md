# About me

I am an incoming PhD student at Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, particularly: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Sublinear Algorithms(like Sketching and Sampling Algorithms, Property Testing and Dimensional Reduction) 
    \item Algorithms for Massive Dataset 
    \item Learning-based/augmented Algorithms 
    \item Theoretical Machine Learning
\end{itemize}
