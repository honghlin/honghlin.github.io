# About me

I am an incoming PhD student at Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, particularly: 
* Sublinear Algorithms(like Sketching and Sampling Algorithms, Property Testing and Dimensional Reduction) 
* Algorithms for Massive Dataset 
* Learning-based/augmented Algorithms 
* Theoretical Machine Learning
