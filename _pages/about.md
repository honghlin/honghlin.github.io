# About Me

I am a fifth-year PhD student at Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [David Woodruff](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/). My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science and Machine Learning, particularly: 
* Sublinear Algorithms (like Sketching and Sampling Algorithms, Property Testing and Dimensionality Reduction) 
* Algorithms for Massive Data 
* Learning-based/Data-driven Algorithms 
* Robustness of Algorithms and Machine Learning.

I am supported by CMU Paul and James Wang Sercomm Presidential Graduate Fellowship for 2023-2024. I was also a student researcher in Google Research for 2024-2025, where I was supervised by Kevin Aydin and Peilin Zhong.

Previously, I did my undergraduate at ACM Honors Class, Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Besides, I was a visiting student at Division of Mathematical Science, Nanyang Technological University, host by Prof. [Yi Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yili/) and a research assistant at [ITCS](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/english/home.aspx), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

Miscellaneous:  I am also an amateur table tennis player with a peak USATT rating of 2000+. As part of the CMU team, we placed 16th at the [2023](https://www.nctta.org/champs/2023/) USA College Table Tennis National Championships and 19th at the [2025](https://www.nctta.org/champs/2025/) Championships.
