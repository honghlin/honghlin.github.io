# About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof [David Woodruff](https://honghlin.github.io/). My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, particularly: 
* Sublinear Algorithms(like Sketching and Sampling Algorithms, Property Testing and Dimensionality Reduction) 
* Algorithms for Massive Data 
* Learning-based/augmented Algorithms 
* Theoretical Machine Learning

Previously, I did my undergraduate at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://sjtu.edu.cn/), where I had worked with Prof. [Yu Yong](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com/) and [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/). Besides, I was a visiting student at [Division of Mathematical Science](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms/about-us/mathematics), Nanyang Technological University, host by Prof. [Yi Li](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yili/) and a research assistant at [ITCS](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/english/home.aspx), Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
